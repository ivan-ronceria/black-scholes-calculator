 # Jarrow-Rudd Binomial Tree and Black-Scholes-Merton Closed Form Option Price Calculator

This script calculates the fair value of a European call/put option under the standard assumptions of the Black-Scholes-Merton model.

Most of the parameters required for both the discrete-time and continuous time models are at the top of the code. However, since the Jarrow-Rudd model can estimate the value of American call/put, you may change the arguments appropriately when the function is called.

Future considerations for the project should would be to calculate the implied volatility and back out the greeks as well.
